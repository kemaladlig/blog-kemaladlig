# Building Scalable Cloud Architectures with Kubernetes

Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration. In this post, I'll share my experience building a scalable search engine infrastructure using K8s.

## The Challenge

We needed a way to manage microservices that could scale up during high traffic and scale down during quiet periods to save costs.

## The Solution

We utilized Huawei Cloud's CCE (Cloud Container Engine) to manage our clusters.

### Key Components:
- **ELB (Elastic Load Balance):** Distributes incoming traffic.
- **SWR (SoftWare Repository):** Manages our Docker images.
- **Auto-scaling Policies:** Configured based on CPU and Memory usage.

## Conclusion

By adopting a cloud-native approach, we achieved 99.9% availability and reduced deployment times by 60%.
